## Introducing pipes/utils

<a href='http://www.recurse.com' title='Made with love at the Recurse Center'><img src='https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2883345/11325206/336ea5f4-9150-11e5-9e90-d86ad31993d8.png' height='20px'/></a>

The `pipesjs/utils` module is to `web streams` what `highland.js` is to `node streams`.
It contains utility functions to make working with `web streams` a lot easier.
For more about `Web Streams`, refer to the [spec](https://streams.spec.whatwg.org).

## About

The `utils` module is to `web streams` what `highland.js` is to `node streams`. It contains utility functions to make working with `web streams` a lot easier. Here's more about `Web Streams` from the [spec](https://streams.spec.whatwg.org) itself:

> Large swathes of the web platform are built on streaming data: that is, data that is created, processed, and consumed in an incremental fashion, without ever reading all of it into memory. The Streams Standard provides a common set of APIs for creating and interfacing with such streaming data, embodied in readable streams, writable streams, and transform streams.

The spec is still evolving but has reached a fairly stable stage with a [reference implementation](https://github.com/whatwg/streams/tree/master/reference-implementation) as well. The API has almost been finalized and `Stream`s are coming to the web very soon!

At it's core, the API exposes three major components:

-   `ReadableStream` encapsulates a source producing values and emits them.
-   -   `TransformStream` are essentially `{ readable, writable}` pairs that take a function which can be used to transform the values flowing through it.
-   -   `WritableStream` encapsulates a sink that receives values and writes to it.

`Stream`s are essentially data structures that handle sequential flow of values. You can split streams, merge them and connect them together in various ways. What's amazing is that, in most cases, they can handle [backpressure](https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/#pipe-chains) automatically, so you don't have to mess with the underlying details.

For further information, the spec is quite informative and easy to read. [Jake Archibald](https://github.com/jakearchibald) also wrote a great [blog post](https://jakearchibald.com/2016/streams-ftw/) on them.

**Heads up:** If you're coming from `node` land, `web streams` are quite a lot different from `node streams` and incompatible with each other.


## Installing

### For browsers

The library depends on [@pipes/core](https://github.com/pipesjs/core), so make sure you include it in before including the library.

You can use either of the builds from the `dist` folder:

```html
    <script src="path/to/web-streams-polyfill.js"></script>
    <script src="path/to/pipes.utils.js"></script>
```

And in your code, all the functions will be available on the `window.Pipes.utils` variable.

```javascript
    let { uniq, compact } = window.Pipes;
```

### For browserify users

The library has a [peer-dependency](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/npm/peer-dependencies/) on [@pipes/core](https://github.com/pipesjs/core), so to install it:

```bash
    npm install @pipes/core @pipes/utils
```

The library is split up into modules, so you can both require the whole library or only parts of it:

```javascript
    let { compact } = require("@pipes/utils");
    let compact = require("@pipes/utils/compact");
```

### For ES6 and Rollup users

If you want, you can directly import the es6 modules like so:

```javascript
    import pipesUtils from "@pipes/utils/src";
    import { compact } from "@pipes/utils/src";
    import compact from "@pipes/utils/src/compact";
```


## API Reference

The `core` library only consists of the following functions:

-   [batch](#batch)
-   [compact](#compact)
-   [cycle](#cycle)
-   [debounce](#debounce)
-   [drop](#drop)
-   [filter](#filter)
-   [head](#head)
-   [intersperse](#intersperse)
-   [last](#last)
-   [pick](#pick)
-   [pluck](#pluck)
-   [repeat](#repeat)
-   [scan](#scan)
-   [slice](#slice)
-   [take](#take)
-   [tap](#tap)
-   [throttle](#throttle)

**Set up code for examples**

```javascript
  // Setup
  let createReadable = data => new ReadableStream({
      start (controller) {
      this.data = data || [1,2,3];

      // Kickstart stream
      controller.enqueue( this.data.pop() );
      },
      pull (controller) {
      if ( !this.data.length )
          return controller.close()

      controller.enqueue( this.data.pop() );
      }
  }),
  createWritable = () => new WritableStream({
      write (chunk) {
      console.log( chunk );
      }
  });
```
